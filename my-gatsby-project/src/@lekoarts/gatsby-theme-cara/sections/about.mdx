## About


I am a php and laravel web developer trying to shift into python and react. I am open to learn new thing and recently I like to design the websites too.
I am searching for the Python django Internship where I can dip into real world projects and increase my learning speed. I am facinated by JavaScript too and wanted to build or develop exciting projects with it.
